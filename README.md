# 🖼️ Image Search App (MERN + OAuth)


A full-stack image search application built using **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node)** with **OAuth authentication** (Google, GitHub, Facebook).  
Users can search images from the **Unsplash API**, view top searches across all users, and manage their personal search history.

## Important Note:
Facebook OAuth integration is not fully configured in this project because my Facebook Developer account is currently under verification, and I haven’t received access to the App ID and Secret yet.
